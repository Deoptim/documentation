Dragonboard 410c support exists in LibreELEC as open-source `freedreno` drivers provided a stable Linux reference implementation of stateful V4L2m2m uAPI usage, allowing Team Kodi developers to evolve support for GBM and EGL/DRMPRIME rendering with zero-copy hardware decoding, which is now the foundation for future support of Kodi on Linux.

Kodi runs well on the Dragonboard 410c due to mature support in the Linux kernel and ffmpeg, but it is a expensive board to purchase and rather fiddly to flash with a LibreELEC image, so is not hardware the project staff recommends. Device support remains in the buildsystem for occasional reference testing of changes and we do not provide release images.
